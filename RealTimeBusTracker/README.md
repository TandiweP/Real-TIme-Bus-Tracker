Title: Real Time Bus Tracker
Description: When the button is pushed, data will be displayed on a mapbox map which shows markers tracking the bus from MIT to Harvard in real time. 
How to Run: Insert your Mapbox access token into line one of the realtimebustracker.js file. 
Roadmap of Future Improvements:  I would like to add a timer that starts when you push the button, so you know it the process has been initialized, and be able to observe how long the tracking time is.
